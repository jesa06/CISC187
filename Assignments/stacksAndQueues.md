# Activity 1: Array data structure
----------------------------------

##  Tasks
1. Using Figure 17 as a model, in the book Data Structures in C++, illustrate the result of each operation in the sequence PUSH(S,4), PUSH(S,1), PUSH(S,3), POP(S), PUSH(S,8), and POP(S) on an initially empty stack S stored in array S[1..6]. **Code is not required. 3 pts**

2. Using Figure 18 as a model, in the book Data Structures in C++, illustrate the result of each operation in the sequence ENQUEUE(Q,4), ENQUEUE(Q,1), ENQUEUE(Q,3), DEQUEUE(Q), ENQUEUE(Q,8), and DEQUEUE(Q) on an initially empty queue Q stored in array Q[1..6]. **Code is not required. 3 pts**

3. Rewrite ENQUEUE and DEQUEUE to detect **underflow** and **overflow** of a queue. (see Listings 4 & 5 in the book). **Code is not required. 1 pt**

4. A stack allows insertion and deletion of elements at only end, and a queue allows insertion at one end and deletion at the other end, a **deque** (double-ended queue) allows insertion and deletion at both ends. Write four O(1)-time procedures to insert elements into and delete elements from both ends of a deque implemented by an array. **Code is not required. 3 pts**
